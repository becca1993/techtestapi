# techtestapi
this is the repository for the flexera tech test. It is a HTTP API


This HTTP API is built with Flask, with one endpoint and four functions: POST, GET, PUT and DELETE. 

This API allows the potential user to have a list of all the people in the database,search for people with a particular name or email, edit a person record or delete a record from the database.

The underlying database is a SQLite database, as it is quick, lightweight and easy to set up.

There is a single endpoint - http://app/people.

There is a start of a frontend which would have been fleshed out if there had been more time. It would allow potential users to add, edit or delete people within the database while logged in.
